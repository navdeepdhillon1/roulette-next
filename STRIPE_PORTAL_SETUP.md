# Stripe Customer Portal Setup Guide

## Why You Need This

The "Manage Billing" button lets users:

## Test Mode vs Live Mode

### Test Mode
- Portal URL: `https://billing.stripe.com/p/session/test_xxxxx`
- Only works with test subscriptions
- Use test cards: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- **Status:** You need to activate this first

### Live Mode
- Portal URL: `https://billing.stripe.com/p/session/live_xxxxx`

## What Happens When User Cancels

When a customer cancels their subscription through the portal:

1. Subscription is marked as `cancel_at_period_end: true`
2. They keep access until end of billing period
3. Webhook sends `customer.subscription.updated` event
4. Your app updates subscription status in Supabase
5. Email notification sent to you (admin)

After the billing period ends:
1. Subscription status changes to `canceled`
2. Webhook sends `customer.subscription.deleted` event
3. User loses access to Pro/Elite features
4. They can re-subscribe anytime from /pricing

---

## Security Notes

‚úÖ **Secure by default:**
- Portal sessions expire after 1 hour
- Each session is unique and one-time use
- Sessions are tied to specific customers
- Return URL is validated by Stripe

üîí **Your app's security:**
- API route validates user authentication token
- Only returns portal URL for authenticated users
- Uses customer ID from Supabase subscription record
- Server-side only (customer ID never exposed to client)

---

### Appearance
- Brand color
- Logo
- Font (uses your Stripe account settings)

### Policies
- Add privacy policy link
- Add terms of service link
