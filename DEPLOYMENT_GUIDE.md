- Deploy to production
- Apply the new environment variables

**Monitor deployment:**
- Go to Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Deployments
- Watch the build log
- Wait for "‚úì Deployed" status

### Option B: Manual Deployment

If auto-deploy is not enabled:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if you haven't
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

If any show ‚ùå, the environment variables didn't load. Trigger a new deployment:

```bash
# Go to Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí ‚ãØ Menu ‚Üí Redeploy
```

2. Cancel any subscriptions you created during testing
3. This keeps your dashboard clean
