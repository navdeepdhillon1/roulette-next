## Feature Implementation Notes

### HOT/COLD/NORM Logic
- **HOT:** Group hitting more than expected (e.g., Red at 60% when expected is 48.6%)
- **COLD:** Group hitting less than expected (e.g., Black at 30% when expected is 48.6%)
- **NORM:** Group performing near expected probability (±10% tolerance)

### Multi-Window Analysis (Pro/Elite)
Time windows analyzed:
- **9 spins:** Immediate short-term momentum
- **18 spins:** Short-term trend confirmation
- **36 spins:** Medium-term pattern
- **72 spins:** Extended trend analysis
- **144 spins:** Long-term convergence observation
- **288 spins:** Maximum historical window

### Custom Groups (Elite Only)
Users can define groups by:
- **Number sets:** Select any combination of numbers (e.g., 1, 5, 9, 13, 17)
- **Named strategies:** "My Birthdays," "Fibonacci Numbers," "Primes Only"
- **Hybrid combinations:** Mix table and wheel bets (e.g., "Red + Voisins")
- **Save limit:** 10 custom groups max per user

### Dealer Analysis (Elite Only)
Tracked metrics per dealer:

## Roulette Type Support

**Currently Supported:**
- ✅ European Roulette (single zero, 37 numbers: 0-36)

**Not Currently Supported:**
- ❌ American Roulette (double zero, 38 numbers: 0-00-36)

**Why European Only?**
- Better house edge (2.7% vs 5.26%)
- Simpler probability calculations
- More common in online/live casinos
- Focus on player-friendly game variant

**Future Consideration:**
American roulette support may be added based on user demand. The mathematical framework supports it, but UI and probability models would need adjustment.
