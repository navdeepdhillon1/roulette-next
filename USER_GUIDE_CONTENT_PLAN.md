# User Guide Content Plan - Roulette Tracker Pro

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT POSITIONING

**Roulette Tracker Pro is a data tracking and analysis tool, NOT a prediction system.**

- ✅ Tracks player-submitted spin outcomes
- ✅ Analyzes historical patterns and statistical deviations
- ✅ Provides pattern-based suggestions using past data
- ✅ Helps with bankroll management and discipline

- ❌ Does NOT predict future outcomes
- ❌ Does NOT claim to overcome house edge
- ❌ Does NOT use AI/ML to predict numbers

All guides must emphasize: **"The system analyzes what HAS happened, not what WILL happen."**

---

#### 9. Betting Systems Explained
**Target Audience:** Elite users
**Length:** 15-20 minutes
**Content:**

**Flat Betting**
- Same bet every time
- Safest option
- Best for beginners
- Pros: Simple, predictable bankroll
- Cons: Slow profit, doesn't recover losses

**Martingale**
- Double bet after every loss
- Reset to base after win
- Pros: Recovers all losses + profit in one win
- Cons: Exponential growth, requires huge bankroll, table limits
- Example: $5 → $10 → $20 → $40 → $80 → $160...

**Fibonacci**
- Follow Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...
- Step forward on loss, back 2 on win
- Pros: Slower growth than Martingale
- Cons: Still risky, can get stuck

**D'Alembert**
- Increase by 1 unit on loss, decrease by 1 on win
- Pros: Gentle progression
- Cons: Can still lead to large bets

**Reverse D'Alembert**
- Opposite: increase on win, decrease on loss
- Ride winning streaks

**Custom**
- Define your own rules
- Set max bet multiplier
- Configure win/loss behavior

**Reality Check:**
- NO system beats the house edge
- They only manage your bet sizing
- All systems eventually lose to house edge
- Use systems for discipline, not profit

---

#### 10. Understanding the Decision Engine
**Target Audience:** Elite users, advanced
**Length:** 12-15 minutes
**Content:**

**Core Concepts:**
- What the engine does: analyzes recent pattern strength in historical data
- What it doesn't do: predict future outcomes
- Time windows: 5, 10, 15 spin analysis of past results
- **Important:** The engine processes player-submitted outcomes, it does not predict numbers

**FOLLOW vs STAY:**
- FOLLOW: analyze trend and suggest betting with it (if lots of red recently, suggest red)
- STAY: analyze trend and suggest betting against it (contrarian)
- How the engine uses statistical analysis to determine which approach

**Pattern Strength Indicators:**
- How pattern strength is calculated from historical data
- What 20%, 50%, 80% pattern strength means
- Why low pattern strength means DON'T BET

**Skip Reasons:**
- Defensive skip: consecutive losses mounting
- Pattern strength skip: pattern too weak in historical data
- Trend skip: trend invalidated
- Volatility skip: too chaotic
- Why skipping protects your bankroll

**Decision Types:**
- BET: pattern strength sufficient based on analysis
- SKIP: one concern detected in data
- SIT_OUT: multiple red flags in statistical analysis

**Survival Probability:**
- Chance of lasting X spins with current bankroll
- When survival falls below 70%, engine becomes more cautious

**Ethical Disclaimer:**
- The decision engine is a data analysis tool, not a prediction system
- It identifies patterns in past data only
- No system can overcome the house edge

---

#### 11. Discipline Metrics: Your Score
**Target Audience:** Elite users
**Length:** 8-10 minutes
**Content:**
- What is discipline tracking?
- Why it matters (following expert advice)
- Suggestion adherence: % of suggestions followed
- Skip discipline: % of skip suggestions followed
- How discipline affects outcomes
- Improving your score:
  - Don't second-guess suggestions
  - When skip says skip, skip!
  - Trust the confidence scores
- Viewing your discipline history

**Psychological Element:**
- Why we override suggestions (greed, fear, impatience)
- Benefits of system-based betting
- Removing emotion from decisions

---

#### 12. Matrix Betting Strategy
**Target Audience:** Elite users, advanced
**Length:** 12-15 minutes
**Content:**
- What is matrix betting?
- Betting multiple groups simultaneously
- Example: Red + Dozen 1 + Column 2 all at once
- Why this is powerful:
  - Hedging: cover multiple outcomes
  - Coverage: increase hit probability
  - Correlation: see which groups win together

**Hedging Strategies:**
- Red + Black with different progressions
- Inside + Outside bets combined
- Dozens overlap coverage

**Risk Management:**
- Don't overcover (leaves no profit)
- Calculate net outcomes per number
- Understand when you profit vs lose

**Example Scenario:**
- Bet $5 on Red (pays even)
- Bet $10 on Dozen 1 (pays 2:1)
- Bet $5 on Column 2 (pays 2:1)
- Calculate profit for each number 1-36

**Warning:**
- More bets = more money at risk
- Doesn't improve odds
- Can make losses larger
- Advanced strategy only
